In 2017 we had no clue about where to spend our holidays. One day Roberta told me to find an original place to go. One day while I was cooking I had a name flipping in my had ... Azores ... but I didn't know anything about that place, at the time nor where it is on the map. My brain probably recorded that name while I was seeing one of the many documentaries I like to see.
I didn't took to much to understand that I wanted to visit the astonishing nature of the Azores and then I called Roberta. "I got it and I know you will like it".
So the phase 2 started: lay out the journey plan balancing it with our budget.

## **Day 1** | 1...2...3 flights in a row to get to Ilha do Pico
Getting to the Azores it was not a comfortable task. We had to take three flights in a row starting from Bergamo to Lisbona, then flying from Lisbona to Ponta Delgada and last from the international airport of Ponta Delgada to Ilha do Pico with a domestic flight.

## **Day 2** | The car problem
Our plan was to rent a car on spot the day after arriving to Ilha do Pico, but actually knew anything about that place. The accommodation was just fantastic but we discovered the hard way that there were no cars available for rent on day one and that there was just one bus in the morning and one in the evening doing the isle round road. I passed half a day spamming calls to all the car rentals on the isle when I finally got a small car for the rest of our days on the isle. BINGO!
