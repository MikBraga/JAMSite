## **Planning**
In February we decided that the holiday destination for 2022 would be Bretagne. Based on the experience of traveling in the Loire region in 2018 ([you can read the post here](https://www.mikbraga.net/post/trip/france-2018)) we immediately decided to make the journey by car.
Having two weeks of time we decided to search and rent a typical country cottage and to use it as our basecamp to explore the surroundings. Using Airbnb, Booking and B&B search engine we found an awesome solution in [Plaudaniel](https://abnb.me/4aMFJkcYVrb) for the first week; for the next couple of days we found a really different solution that we couldn't resist to try: an houseboat in [Saint-Domineuc](https://abnb.me/5qiOyFZZWrb).
For the outward journey we decided to make two stops without booking accommodation for the night in advance. For the return trip we opted for the same strategy even if at the start of the vacation nothing was set in stone.  

## **Day 1** | First steps
The plan for the first day was to pass the Mont Blanc Tunnel by midday and to go wild for the rest of the day. Driving west we made our first stop at Les Gourges du Fier. The day was so hot that we decided to to move on and drive as much as we could. We booked a room for the night at the [Quality Hotel Clermont Kennedy](https://goo.gl/maps/ZJfW9EngvHnZnequ5) in Clermont-Ferrand.

## **Day 2** | Approaching Bretagne
After sleeping in the suburb of Clermont Ferrand we spent the next morning visiting the city. The cathedral and the alleys of the old town were a wonderful surprise.
