## **Planning**
In February we decided that the holiday destination for 2022 would be Bretagne. Based on the experience of traveling in the Loire region in 2018 ([you can read the post here](https://www.mikbraga.net/post/trip/france-2018)) we immediately decided to make the journey by car.
Having two weeks of time we decided to search and rent a typical country house and to us it a basecamp to explore the surroundings. Using Airbnb, Booking and B&B search engine we found an awesome solution in [Plaudaniel](https://abnb.me/4aMFJkcYVrb) for the first week; for the next couple of days we found a really different solution that we couldn't resist to try: an houseboat in [Saint-Domineuc](https://abnb.me/5qiOyFZZWrb).
For the outward journey we decided to make two stops without booking accommodation for the night in advance. For the return trip we decided to adopt the same strategy even if for the moment nothing has been set in stone.  

## **Day 1** | First steps
The plan for today is to pass the Mont Blanc Tunnel and the head our car to Annecy where we plan to have our first stop.
